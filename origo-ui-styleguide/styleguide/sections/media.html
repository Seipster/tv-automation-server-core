    <h2>Media elements</h2>
    <p>
      The media element is a concept from OOCSS. It is a generic structure
      that can be used to solve surprisingly many component-level layouts.
      It has a fixed-width "thing" (typically a picture, but can be
      anything) on the left and free-floating content on the right, which
      does not flow below the left-side content even if it is longer.

              Here you can see a cat resting. It is probably very tired, as it
              has apparently fallen entirely asleep. It is probably having a
              good time.

              This text is somewhat long in order to illustrate how the text
              flows next to the image on the left, and never below. If you
              cannot see it, try resizing the window smaller.
