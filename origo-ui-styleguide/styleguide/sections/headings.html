    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>
      Headings are among the few tags that have styles applied directly to
      them. Headings are commonly used, so it is assumed that default styles
      (e.g. not having to class them all) will be useful. This is still
      currently undecided.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also classes <code>.h1</code> etc to emulate the visual
      styles of the various headings, which can be used with any element
      (including headings - thus enabling semantic use of headers). These
      enable reusable components that can be shared with other projects that
      may not use the same baseline CSS. Reusable components should not make
      any assumptions about element styles - they should strictly rely on
      classes with defined behavior.
