    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>
      When you have read about the core principles underpinning the
      styleguide and the CSS implementation, you may want to check out the
      tutorial-style <a href="getting-started/">Getting started</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Core principles</h2>
    <p>
      The CSS is based on the principles behind OOCSS by Nicole Sullivan. It
      does not, however, use the OOCSS framework or any of its components.
      The following is an overview of the important principles that underly
      the implementation.
    </p>
    <h3>Separate components and layout</h3>
    <p>
      All layout concerns are handled by the <a href="#layout">layout
      system</a> - individual components should not reimplement it.
      Components should focus strictly on adjusting positioning/spacing from
      the defaults made by the layout system, as well as the component
      "skinning" (backgrounds, borders, font adjustments and so on). This
      ensures that there is one authorative source for layout specification,
      enabling us to easily adjust if necessary, and keep centralized
      control over responsive layouts.
    </p>
    <h3>Components should always look the same</h3>
    <p>
      Any component should always look the same, regardless of its context.
      If you move a component from the left column to the right, it should
      still look the same. The layout details may give it different outer
      dimensions, but the internal skinning should not change. This ensures
      easily composable UIs and easy reuse of visual components.
    </p>
    <h3>Style classes, not elements</h3>
    <p>
      Styling directly on elements prevents multiple presentations of the
      same elements without resorting to overriding styles. Overriding
      styles lead to CSS bloat and is highly discouraged. Overriding styles
      will also interfere with the previous principle, and may cause
      surprising results when moving components around. Styling directly on
      classes avoids this problem. There are only a few cases where styles
      are applied directly to elements, and those situations are highlighted
      in this docment.
    </p>
    <h3>Avoid decendant selectors</h3>
    <p>
      Decendant selectors such as the child selector (<code>p a</code>) are
      generally discouraged because they may interfere with the principle
      that components should always look the same, regardless of their
      context. However, the closer together the elements in the selector
      are, the less likely it is that they will create a problem. (A
      selector as wide-reaching as <code>.aside .media</code>
      is <strong>strongly</strong> discouraged). Decendant selectors are
      used, but very sparingly.
    </p>

    <h2>Keyboard focus</h2>
    <p>
      All components should display focus outlines in a consistent way.
